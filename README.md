## 📌 Project Overview

The **Fake News Detection System** is an intelligent application built using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**. The aim is to combat misinformation by providing a quick way to verify the authenticity of a news article.

This project includes:
- Clean model training using TF-IDF & Logistic Regression
- A lightweight, interactive web application using **Streamlit**
- Optimized architecture with a modular and scalable structure
