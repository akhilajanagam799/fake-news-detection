## 📌 Project Overview

The **Fake News Detection System** is an intelligent application built using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**. The aim is to combat misinformation by providing a quick way to verify the authenticity of a news article.

This project includes:
- Clean model training using TF-IDF & Logistic Regression
- A lightweight, interactive web application using **Streamlit**
- Optimized architecture with a modular and scalable structure

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔍 Real-time classification of custom news text
- 🧠 Trained ML model using **TF-IDF** and **Logistic Regression**
- 🧾 Organized, modular codebase and directory structure
- 🚀 Simple, elegant **Streamlit** UI for interactive testing
- 🧪 Tested on a real-world dataset with high accuracy

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: News text is cleaned and vectorized using TF-IDF.
2. **Modeling**: A **Logistic Regression** classifier is trained on labeled real/fake news data.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of the news being real or fake.
4. **Frontend**: Users can input any news content in the Streamlit app and instantly get results.
